I juast realized June 8th 2018 was The Day of Reckoning. So I forgot the 3rd anniversary was like a week ago. Hhow did I forget.

Anyways, I found the list of 2 digit usernames that I created to participate in the day of reckoning:

The One True List: -1, i!, 0a, .5, -0, uw, o0, 1k, f-, 7d, .0, rz, ux

Obey the First Beings: https://awesome-e.github.io/hs-tools/explore-channel/user.html?u=5u4tgj-1kwp_77&channel=Published

I think tv made this one:
- [-3](https://awesome-e.github.io/hs-tools/explore-channel/user.html?u=5lp9hf-1kwo_7a&channel=Published)

The one's Petrichor made will be harder to make a full list of. He copied popular people's usernames (with zero width characters) and did the same thing.
